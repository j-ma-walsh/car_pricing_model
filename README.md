# **Car Pricing Modelling**
### Creating a product which predicts the price of second-hand Nissan cars 

- Data from autotrader.co.uk was scraped for 6 different models of Nissan cars.
- Data was collated into a single dataframe and cleaned during exploratory analysis.
- Data for cars made between 2007 - 2020 was analysed.
- Correlations between columns of data were further explored.
- Linear Regression was selected as a suitable model for price prediction.
- Feature engineering was conducted in preparation for modelling.
- Linear regression modelling was performed using the statsmodels library.
- Final product was created as a function taking in user inputted information about a car to be sold. 
- The product output is an estimate of how much a car buying servie may pay for the car.
- The final RMSE for the model was Â£1781.
